# Sally Sam, Data Scientist
## Python, nature and a dark sense of humour!

Hello, I'm Sally üíÉüèø! I grew up in Birmingham, UK and lived in Cardiff, Manchester, Darwen and Leeds. I have now settled in the beautiful Hebden Bridge where the photo above was taken. If you get the chance to visit, be very quiet and you might spot the local roe deer.

When I'm not coding in Python, you can find me out in nature avoiding pythons. I'm either on a hike, rock climbing or camping üèï. My favourite places to go are Llanberis and Criccieth in North Wales. I love exploring so recommendations are very welcome! Next on my list is to visit [Rufford Ford](https://goo.gl/maps/Yxwb7Ku65RvFtxh29). Take a look at the videos online if you've not heard of it yet, there is something mesmirising about it.

In the week, you might find me at my local High Intesity fitness class and/or with a beer in my hand. They're not mutually exclusive but I wouldn't recommend it! I'm also really grateful to [Code and Stuff](https://codeandstuff-manchester.github.io/) who organise coding and networking open sessions for women and non-binary developers in Manchester. The highlight of my week!
